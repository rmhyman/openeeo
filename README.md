There has been a lot of talk about diversity in Silicon Valley.  Companies have started to release data about their demographic makeup, and they release their [EEO-1 reports](https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/index.cfm) along with their own data analysis.
Both of these formats are not in a format for the public to perform their own data analysis since the EEO-1 reports are typically released as images or PDFs
And the data used for their findings are not made public.
This repo is for placing EEO reports in a Analyzable format for Open Data Analysis
